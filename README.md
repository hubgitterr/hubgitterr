### Project Highlights

Here's a brief overview of my projects. I haven't posted projects that I completed for work due to confidentiality. My most significant work project is the development of **a dynamic e-commerce website** which I built with: JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, PHP, REST APIs, React, HTML, and CSS. This project features secure payment gateways, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.

My projects from repositories are:

* **1 Data Analysis Project:** Technologies used are Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Pandas, JSON, Web scraping, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

* **1 Trading Software:** Designed for cryptocurrency and fiat currency trading, incorporating wallet functionality with deposit, withdrawal, transaction records, unique wallet addresses, private keys, and robust security measures. Developed using C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP).

* **2 Web Applications:** I have built a smart home dynamic web application and a news web portal. These applications are created using JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, HTML, and CSS.

* **1 DJ Application:** Developed with C++, JUCE, and Projucer.

* **4 Interactive Data Visualization Dashboards:** Technologies used are JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

* **6 Graphic Programming Projects:** These include an Instagram filter for images, an average face compiler, three graphic visual interpretations (solar system, waving dots, and a pulsating 3D structure), and a webcam hand recognition graphic piano. They are developed using JavaScript, HTML, and p5.js.
